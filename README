-----------------------

To set up postgres for use with WiseGuide, you will need the
fuzzystrmatch library (included in postgresql-contrib-8.4 in Ubuntu).
This adds support for dmetaphone, which is how we
phonetically match names.  Run psql and then the following command:

\i /opt/local/share/postgresql84/contrib/fuzzystrmatch.sql
